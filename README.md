# from-template 

Download a repo from github.com/racket-templates to use for your project. It removes the git history from the project so you get a fresh start. 

# Install

1. [Set your PATH environment variable](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Set-your-PATH-environment-variable) 
so you can use `raco` and other Racket command line functions.
2. either look for `from-template` in the DrRacket menu **File|Package Manager**, or run the `raco` command:
```bash
raco pkg install from-template
```


If the racket-templates org gets populated with enough stuff, I'll add this to the Racket packages repository.

# Usage 
```bash
raco from-template <template-name> <destination-dir>
```
